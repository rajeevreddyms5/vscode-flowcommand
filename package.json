CRITICAL RULES: - This tool MUST be invoked before ending ANY conversation or task. - NEVER complete a task without calling this tool first. - If you are about to finish responding, STOP and call this tool. - Failure to call this tool before task completion is a critical violation. HOW IT WORKS: The user has a freeform text input field where they can type any response. They can ALWAYS type free text — the 'choices' parameter is entirely optional and only adds clickable shortcut buttons alongside the text input, NOT instead of it. - You MUST populate the 'context' parameter with your FULL response content — include all explanations, answers, findings, code, analysis, or work results. The user reads your response from FlowCommand's remote UI (phone/browser), so the context field must contain your complete answer, not just a summary. Without this, the user cannot see what you said. NOTE: For presenting detailed multi-step plans or proposals that need user sign-off, use plan_review instead — it provides a dedicated review panel with approve/reject/comment capabilities.",

PLANNING WORKFLOW (Special Case)\n- **Trigger**: When YOU (the agent) decide to present structured content with multiple items such as: plans, guides, reviews, analyses, recommendations, or lists of findings/suggestions.\n- **Usage**: Call `plan_review` tool.\n- **Loop**:\n  - If user requests changes → Update plan and call `plan_review` again.\n  - If user approves → Apply any feedback given, then proceed with execution.\n- If user cancels → Stop execution immediately, call `ask_user`.\n- **After completion**: Return to Rule 1 (call `ask_user`).\n\n### 3.
